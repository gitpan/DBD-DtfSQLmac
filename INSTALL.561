(INSTALL.561)


*** Please read the README document first. ***



--------------------------------- NOTE -------------------------------------
This distribution contains shared libraries, which are loaded dynamically  
by MacPerl -- well, normally. Currently, dynamic loading of shared libs  
does NOT work with the MPW MacPerl tool when built with Apple's MrC compiler. 
However, dynamic loading always works with the MacPerl application and the 
MacPerl tool when built with the Metrowerks compilers. Hence, those of you 
who have downloaded a pre-built MacPerl 5.6.1 distribution should have
no problems. Note also that dynamic loading is NOT supported by the 68K 
versions of the MacPerl application and tool.

Installation for new MacPerl 5.6.1 (and higher):
=================================================

Installation is quite easy. Always install the DBI module first. The pre-built 
DBI module (version 1.21 as of this writing) for MacPerl 5.6.1 is available via 
the MacPerl Module Porters page (http://dev.macperl.org/mmp/). As with every 
module, use the installme.plx droplet for installation. This droplet is part of 
the MacPerl 5.6.1 distribution. 

After you've installed the DBI module, simply drop the DBD-DtfSQLmac-0.3201.tar.gz 
packed archive or the unpacked folder DBD-DtfSQLmac-0.3201 on the installme.plx 
droplet. Answer the upcoming question "Convert all text and MacBinary files?" with 
"Yes". This should install the module properly. 

Afterwards, you have to install the dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library 'dtFPPCSV2.8K.shlb'
by hand. The dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library comes with the distribution that you have
to download from sLAB's web site (see the README document or DtfSQL.pm for details).
Either put the 'dtFPPCSV2.8K.shlb' shared library (or at least an alias to it) in 
the SAME folder as the shared library 'DtfSQL' that comes with this module (by 
default, this folder is ':site_perl:MacPPC:auto:Mac:DtfSQL:) or put the dtF/SQL 2.01 
shared library in the System Extensions folder. This is crucial since this module 
can only be used in conjunction with the dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library.

To be sure that everything is ok and the module loads properly, run the test.pl script 
first. Then run the test scripts located in the 't' folder. Some samples are provided 
in the 'samples' folder, to help you getting started.

Have fun.

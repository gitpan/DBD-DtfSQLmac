*INSTALL.561


--------------------------------- NOTE -------------------------------------
This distribution contains shared libraries, which are loaded dynamically  
by MacPerl -- well, normally. Currently, dynamic loading of shared libs  
does NOT work with the MPW MacPerl tool when built with Apple's MrC compiler. 
However, dynamic loading always works with the MacPerl application and the 
MacPerl tool when built with the Metrowerks compilers. Hence, those of you 
who have downloaded a pre-built MacPerl 5.6.1 distribution should have
no problems. Note also that dynamic loading is NOT supported by the 68K 
versions of the MacPerl application and tool.

Installation for new MacPerl 5.6.1 (and higher):
=================================================

Installation is quite easy. Always install the DBI module first. The pre-built 
DBI module (version 1.20 as of this writing) for MacPerl 5.6.1 is available from 
my website at

    http://usemacperl.esmartweb.com//dbi.html
	

If you are using the MacPerl MPW tool, change directory to ":MacPerl-5.6.1:"
in the MPW-Shell.

Run the INSTALL.pl script. This should install the modules and the shared 
library properly. Note that the destination folder by default is

    $ENV{MACPERL}site_perl:

(the "site_perl" folder will be created if need be). However, you are able 
to override this default. On the console, the install script asks for an 
alternative destination directory. This should be (or should become) one of 
your search paths for library modules, or MacPerl might not find the new 
modules. Simply hit <Return> or <Enter> (MPW-Shell) when the default fits 
your needs.

After installation, run the test.pl script first, to see if the module loads. 
Then run the test scripts located in the 't' folder. Some samples are provided 
in the 'samples' folder, to help you getting started.


Important note:
===============
This module can only be used in conjunction with the Mac::DtfSQL module, which 
is part of this distribution. If you use the pre-build version of the Mac::DtfSQL 
module or you've built the Mac::DtfSQL module as a shared library that depends on 
the dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library 'dtFPPCSV2.8K.shlb', then this module needs to 
know where the dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library is located on your harddisk. Either 
put the dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library 'dtFPPCSV2.8K.shlb' (or at least an alias to 
it) in the *same* folder as the shared library 'DtfSQL' built from the extension 
module (by default, the folder is ':site_perl :MacPPC:auto:Mac:DtfSQL:) or put the 
dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library in the *system extensions* folder.

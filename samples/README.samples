Dear MacPerl user,

to run the sample scripts, you first have to create a sample
database. To create one, run the createSampleDB.pl script.
This script creates the sample database 'SampleDB.dtf' in the 
current folder (user 'dtfadm', password 'dtfadm'). Its size 
will be approximately 780 KB. Four user tables will be created 
and filled with some data for playing around.

Enjoy.

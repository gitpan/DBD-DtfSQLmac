*INSTALL.5004

Installation for old MacPerl 5.2.0r4:
======================================

Installation is quite easy. First, install the Mac build of the DBI 1.08 module, 
available from the MacPerl Module Porters Page at http://pudge.net/mmp/. As with 
every module, use Chris Nandor's installme.plx droplet for installation. This 
installer is part of the cpan-mac-0.50 module, available from CPAN 

    http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/CNANDOR/ 
	
or via Chris Nandor's MacPerl page 

    http://pudge.net/macperl/.

After you've installed the DBI module, simply drop the DBD-DtfSQLmac-0.2201.tar.gz 
packed archive or the unpacked folder DBD-DtfSQLmac-0.2201 on the installme.plx 
droplet. Answer the upcoming question "Convert all text and MacBinary files?" with 
"Yes". This should install the module properly. To be sure, run the test.pl script 
first, to see if the module loads. Then run the test scripts located in the 't' 
folder. Some samples are provided in the 'samples' folder, to help you getting 
started.


Important note:
===============
This module can only be used in conjunction with the Mac::DtfSQL module, which 
is part of this distribution. If you use the pre-build version of the Mac::DtfSQL 
module or you've built the Mac::DtfSQL module as a shared library that depends on 
the dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library 'dtFPPCSV2.8K.shlb', then this module needs to 
know where the dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library is located on your harddisk. Either 
put the dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library 'dtFPPCSV2.8K.shlb' (or at least an alias to 
it) in the *same* folder as the shared library 'DtfSQL' built from the extension 
module (by default, the folder is ':site_perl :MacPPC:auto:Mac:DtfSQL:) or put the 
dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library in the *system extensions* folder.

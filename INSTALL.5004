Installation for old MacPerl 5.2.0r4:
======================================

Installation is quite easy. First, install the Mac build of the DBI 1.08 module, 
available from the MacPerl Module Porters page (http://dev.macperl.org/mmp/). As 
with every module, use Chris Nandor's installme.plx droplet for installation. This 
installer is part of the cpan-mac-0.50 module, available from CPAN 

    http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/id/CNANDOR/ 
	
or via Chris Nandor's MacPerl page 

    http://pudge.net/macperl/.

After you've installed the DBI module, simply drop the DBD-DtfSQLmac-0.3201.tar.gz 
packed archive or the unpacked folder DBD-DtfSQLmac-0.3201 on the installme.plx 
droplet. Answer the upcoming question "Convert all text and MacBinary files?" with 
"Yes". This should install the module properly. 

Afterwards, you have to install the dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library 'dtFPPCSV2.8K.shlb'
by hand. The dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library comes with the distribution that you have
to download from sLAB's web site (see the README document or DtfSQL.pm for details).
Either put the 'dtFPPCSV2.8K.shlb' shared library (or at least an alias to it) in 
the SAME folder as the shared library 'DtfSQL' that comes with this module (by 
default, this folder is ':site_perl:MacPPC:auto:Mac:DtfSQL:) or put the dtF/SQL 2.01 
shared library in the System Extensions folder. This is crucial since this module 
can only be used in conjunction with the dtF/SQL 2.01 shared library.

To be sure that everything is ok and the module loads properly, run the test.pl script 
first. Then run the test scripts located in the 't' folder. Some samples are provided 
in the 'samples' folder, to help you getting started.

Have fun.
